This file defines the hashes of scripts that are allowed to execute. Jenkins
requires an administrator to approve scripts before they are allowed to run.

This file was generated by approving the script under
Jenkins -> Manage Jenkins -> In-process Script Approval, and copying the
resulting file at /var/jenkins_home/scriptApproval.xml.
